### Final Project (Grading Question's)

## Process
1) add a section that describes the process you followed to complete your assignment. 
(Start by discussing how you came up with the idea and/or why you settle on this particular project.)

## Problems and Problem Solving
2) Detail your research (e.g. include links to tutorials, and/or stackoverflow-like phorums), as well as your struggles (e.g. compilation/linking issues, etc) and the way you either solved them and/or worked around them.

## Solutions and Lessons Learned
3) Detail the issues you came up with, and most importantly, all things you took away from the process. 
(Remember, the main goal of this assignment is to have you showcase your learning process.)

## Future Work
4) let us know about possible ways to improve it.
